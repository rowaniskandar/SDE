# Installation

Please refer to each file (.jl and .R) to find the required packages prior to running the codes.

## Julia
The file, cohmod.jl, is required for running the examples in Julia. One key package is DifferentialEquations package (https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).

## R
The R codes are self-contained.  One key package is the YUIMA package (https://github.com/cran/yuima).

## The Julia Language

Julia language is not used widespread in decision modeling.  Here are some of the main sites for new users.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical
computing.  The main homepage for Julia can be found at
[julialang.org](https://julialang.org/).  This is the GitHub
repository of Julia source code, including instructions for compiling
and installing Julia, below.

### Terminal, Editors and IDEs

The Julia REPL is quite powerful.  See the section in the manual on
[the Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/REPL/)
for more details.

Support for editing Julia is available for many
[widely used editors](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport):
[Emacs](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs),
[Vim](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vim),
[Sublime Text](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/Julia-sublime), and many
others.

Supported IDEs include: [Juno](http://junolab.org/) (Atom plugin),
[julia-vscode](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vscode) (VS
Code plugin), and
[julia-intellij](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-intellij)
(IntelliJ IDEA plugin). The popular [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
notebook interface is available through
[IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).
