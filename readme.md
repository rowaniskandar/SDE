# Installation

Please refer to each file (.jl and .R) to find the required packages prior to running the codes.

## Julia
The file, cohmod.jl, is required for running the examples in Julia. One key package is DifferentialEquations package (https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).

## R
The R codes are self-contained.  One key package is the YUIMA package (https://github.com/cran/yuima).

## The Julia Language

Julia language is not used widespread in decision modeling.  Here are some of the main sites for new users.
